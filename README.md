# simple-Storage-Smart-Contracts-using-Ethers-JS-
A smart contract made in solidity for simple storage of the Main-net  etherium and test-net. It is further deployed in node js and the whole thing is ether js.

*Firstly in your terminal install ehters js file for the node_modules  using npm install ethers js (for window) or by using yarn add ethers js (for linux and mac users). 

*Secondly you can watch tutorial for it in youtube and run your simple storage smart contract it would be easy for you.

*PLease download ganache for the local blockchain network which is fake. From there you will get fake private key with 100 Test ETH. I'll prefer watch tutorial for how to work in ethers js. It is somewhere little complicated.
